## Open Source

I am a developer of [Micronaut](http://micronaut.io), the JVM framework, since its inception. I write / review most of the [Micronaut Guides](https://guides.micronaut.io). I work a lot in the [Security](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/index.html), [Views](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/index.html), [RSS](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-rss/latest/guide/index.html) Micronaut's  modules. 
 
Moreover, I have worked a lot with [Grails Framework](https://grails.org). I have contributed to the framework core code, plugins and guides. 

## Work 

I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Object Computing](https://objectcomputing.com). OCI is the company behind both, frameworks Micronaut and Grails. I am fortunate to have a job contributing to open source.

Moreover, I often support Object Computing's clients with both frameworks, Micronaut and Grails. 

## Writing

Since early 2015, Sergio has been the author of the newsletter [Groovy Calamari](https://groovycalamari.com).  

## Conference & Public Speaking

I often [talk in conferences](http://localhost/sergiodelamo.com/blog/tag/slides.html). Both in Spain and Internationally. Mostly, about Groovy related technologies, Micronaut and Grails.

Since 2019, I organize [Greach Conference](https://greachconf.com).
