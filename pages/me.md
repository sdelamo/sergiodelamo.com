## Open Source

I am a Distinguished Engineer at [Object Computing](https://objectcomputing.com), where I work as a [Micronaut Framework](https://micronaut.io) Development Lead. Moreover, I work as a Developer Advocate for [Micronaut Framework](https://micronaut.io), [Grails](https://grails.org) frameworks, and the [Apache Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org) programming language.

I have been a core developer of the Micronaut Framework since its inception. I write / review most of the [Micronaut Guides](https://guides.micronaut.io). I work a lot in the [Security](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/index.html), [AWS](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/index.html), [Views](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/index.html), [RSS](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-rss/latest/guide/index.html), [Problem+JSON](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-problem-json/latest/guide/index.html), [Email](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-email/latest/guide/index.html), Micronaut's modules.
