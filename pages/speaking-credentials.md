Since 2015, I have been regularly speaking at conferences and user groups. Mostly about Micronaut and Grails frameworks.  

I do [online webinars and short videos on the Micronaut Framework Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9UkPxJVi4FT3gitylnECKe27Aar1c_Er).

Iâ€™ve presented at conferences such as JCON, JBCNConf, ApacheCon, GeeCon, GR8Conf, Greach, and GGX, and in many user groups such as Manchester JUG, Merida MX JUG, Madrid GUG, Barcelona JUG, London GUG.
