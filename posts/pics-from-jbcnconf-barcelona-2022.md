I presented a workshop about [Micronaut Security](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/) at [JBCNConf 2022](https://www.jbcnconf.com/2022/). They [published many pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/barcelonajug/collections/72157720937175671/), and I fetched a couple where I appeared.

It was great to meet with the core Micronaut Framework team. We went for dinner at [Boca Grande](https://bocagrande.cat/es/boca-grande-es/), a really nice restaurant.
