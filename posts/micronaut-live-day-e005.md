In the 5th session of [Micronaut Live](https://sergiodelamo.com/blog/micronaut-live-introduction.html), I integrate [Micronaut Context Events](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#contextEvents) to the application. We trigger an event when a user subscribes to the newsletter and we use the `@Async` annotation to process it asynchronously.

Checkout the [Github repository](https://github.com/micronaut-advocacy/micronaut-live-newsletter/) which contains the application's code.

For another Micronaut Live session, [tune in to twitch](https://twitch.tv/micronautfw) tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. CDT / 17:30 CET to continue building a Micronaut Application.
