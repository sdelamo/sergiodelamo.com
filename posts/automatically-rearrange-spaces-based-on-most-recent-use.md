I enjoyed the _Mac Power Users_ podcast episode, [#600: Mac Migration & Settings](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/600), where [David Sparks](https://www.macsparky.com) and [Stephen Hackett](https://512pixels.net) covered MacOS settings.

I agree that `Automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use`, which is checked by default, is probably the worst MacOS default setting.
