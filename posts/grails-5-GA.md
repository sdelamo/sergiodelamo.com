[%summary]

A [new mayor release of the Grails framework](https://grails.org/blog/2021-10-11-grails-5-ga.html).

Grails stands on the shoulder of Giants. This release elevates the framework by updating those Giants. 

 > This release includes [Apache Groovy 3](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html), [Micronaut framework 3](https://micronaut.io/2021/08/18/micronaut-framework-3-released/), [Gradle 7](https://docs.gradle.org/7.0/release-notes.html), [Spring Boot 2.5](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.5-Release-Notes), [Spring framework 5.3](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Upgrading-to-Spring-Framework-5.x#upgrading-to-version-53), and [Spock 2.0](https://spockframework.org/spock/docs/2.0/release_notes.html).
 
 It should be seamless upgrade. 
 
 > For applications on Grails framework 4, it should be an easy upgrade, as there are not many API changes in Grails framework 5. Also, most Grails framework 4 plugins should work just fine, unless they are using specific Spring, Spring Boot, or Groovy APIs that have been changed or removed.

Congratulations to [@puneetbhl](https://twitter.com/puneetbhl), [@Schlogen](https://twitter.com/Schlogen), [@davydotcom](https://twitter.com/davydotcom) and the whole [Grails](https://grails.org) Community.
