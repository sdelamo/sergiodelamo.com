Starting today at 10:30 US CDT/ 17:30 CET, I will be streaming at [twitch.tv/micronautfw](https://twitch.tv/micronautfw). 

The goal is to stream twice a week and write a Micronaut application live with the help of the viewers. Hopefully, this stream becomes a place to gather and discuss how to code things with Micronaut. 

Moreover, I want the outcome of the streams to be something useful, open-source that we all can use for our projects. For this initial session, I plan to write a newsletter subscribers repository. Join me!
