[%summary]

We first discuss how to build an MCP server with Java without any framework, and then compare what the frameworks
([Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io), and [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io)) offer.

We will implement an MCP server with each framework. The MCP server will expose custom tools that can be accessed by MCP clients.

You will learn how to test your implementation using the [MCP Inspector tool](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) and connect to your MCP server with [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) as a client.

## Target Audience

Developers interested in creating an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server in Java.

## Elevator Pitch

MCP allows you to expose reusable tools and resources to build agentic microservices. Doing this takes us beyond basic LLM chatbots to dynamic, problem-solving systems that deliver real value in real professional settings. In this session, you will learn how to build your first MCP server.
