> In this session, Sergio del Amo introduces the Micronaut® framework and demonstrates how the Framework's unique compile-time approach enables the development of ultra-lightweight Java applications. Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework include: Develop applications with Java, Kotlin, or Apache Groovy Sub-second startup time Small processes that can run in as little as 10 MB of JVM heap No runtime reflection Dependency injection and AOP Reflection-free serialization A database access toolkit that uses ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces. Cloud-native features Sergio also demonstrates how you can generate GraalVM native images of your Micronaut applications to achieve instant startup and ultra-low memory footprint. 

In you are in Warsaw for [GeeCon 2022](https://2022.geecon.org/schedule/) say hello 👋🏻.
