On July 31 2020, I gave an introduction to Micronaut talk at [Merida (Mexico) Java user group](https://twitter.com/JugMerida). Due to Covid-19, the user group has moved to online events. It is great to create Micronaut content in Spanish. If you want me to talk in your local user group, please [contact me](https://sergiodelamo.com/contact.html).
