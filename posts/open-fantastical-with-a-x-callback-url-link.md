I have a _Morning Routing_ project in [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) which includes an entry to check [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical). In the Omnifocus item's note, I have a link to open Fantastical.  

[x-fantastical3://show/calendar](x-fantastical3://show/calendar)

This is possible thanks to [x-callback-url](http://x-callback-url.com) links:

> Using x-callback-urlâ€™s source apps can launch other apps passing data and context information, and also provide parameters instructing the target app to return data and control back to the source app after executing an action.
