Presented at [Bucharest JUG](https://sergiodelamo.com/blog/micronaut-webinar-bucharest-2021-09-16.html), [Manchester JUG](https://sergiodelamo.com/blog/micronaut-webinar-manchester-2022-03-17.html), [Merida (Mexico) JUG](https://sergiodelamo.com/blog/jugmerida-intro-to-micronaut.html)

In this session, [Sergio del Amo](https://sergiodelamo.com) - Micronaut developer advocate and core committer - introduces the Micronaut framework and demonstrates how Micronaut’s unique compile-time approach enables the development of ultra-lightweight Microservices for Java. 

Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework include:

- Subsecond startup time
- Small processes that can run in as little as 10 MB of JVM heap
- No runtime reflection
- Dependency Injection and AOP
- Reflection-free serialization 
- A database access toolkit that uses Ahead of Time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces.
- Cloud Native

Sergio will also demonstrate how you can generate GraalVM native images of your Micronaut applications to achieve instant startup and ultra-low memory footprint.

# Elevator Pitch

This talk is a live coding presentation of the Micronaut framework. Attendees will discover what the framework offers, how easy is to get started and what are the most exciting features about the framework. https://micronaut.io
