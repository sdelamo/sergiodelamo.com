In this session, [Sergio del Amo](https://sergiodelamo.com) introduces the [Micronaut® framework](https://micronaut.io) and demonstrates how the Framework's unique compile-time approach enables the development of ultra-lightweight Java applications.

Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework include:

- Develop applications with Java, Kotlin, or Apache Groovy
- Sub-second startup time
- Small processes that can run in as little as 10 MB of JVM heap
- No runtime reflection
- Dependency injection and AOP
- Reflection-free serialization 
- A database access toolkit that uses ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces.
- Cloud-native features

Sergio also demonstrates how you can generate GraalVM native images of your Micronaut applications to achieve instant startup and ultra-low memory footprint.

Sergio del Amo is a Micronaut core committer,  Developer Advocate for the Micronaut Foundation, and host of the [Micronaut podcast](https://micronautpodcast.com).

# Elevator Pitch

This talk demonstrates how easy it is to get started with the [Micronaut Framework](https://micronaut.io) through live-coding examples. Attendees will discover the most exciting features of the Framework and leave with the fundamentals necessary to begin building Micronaut applications.
