In this session, [Sergio del Amo](https://sergiodelamo.com) introduces the Micronaut framework and demonstrates how Micronaut’s unique compile-time approach enables the development of ultra-lightweight Java applications. 

Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework include:

- Sub-second startup time
- Small processes that can run in as little as 10 MB of JVM heap
- No runtime reflection
- Dependency Injection and AOP
- Reflection-free serialization 
- A database access toolkit that uses Ahead of Time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces.
- Cloud-Native

Sergio will also demonstrate how you can generate GraalVM native images of your Micronaut applications to achieve instant startup and ultra-low memory footprint.

Sergio del Amo is a Micronaut core committer,  developer advocate, and host of the [Micronaut podcast](https://micronautpodcast.com).

# Elevator Pitch
