My favourite podcast of 2020 was [20 Macs for 2020](https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/08/20-macs-for-2020-an-introduction/)

> With this year marking the turn of decades (in some particularly disastrous ways, as it turns out), I decided to construct a list of the 20 most notable Macs in history. Over the next 20 weeks, Iâ€™ll post essays, podcasts, and videos about each of them, counting down to number one

In a similar flavour, I am going to write a list of my favourite _21 MacOS applications in 2021_. 

To start _21 apps for 2021_, let me point you to [Amphetamine]([%external_url]), a keep-awake utility, by [William Gustafson](https://twitter.com/x74353). 

Often, I need to run a long builds in my computer.Moreover, I want to keep it awake while the tests run. For example, I am currently running the test suite of [Micronaut Guides](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-guides/pulls) in preparation for [Micronaut 3 release](https://micronaut.io). 

I find myself often starting an Amphetamine session which should last while the Terminal is running:

If you ever need to keep your computer awake, Amphetamine is the app you have been looking for.
