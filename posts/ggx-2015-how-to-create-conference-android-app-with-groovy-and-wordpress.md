> In this talk Sergio will show you how to create conference websites with WordPress custom post types and custom fields, use a Groovy Android library to consume your WordPressâ€™s generated JSON API, and create a simple Android App which shows the conference data. Also, if you would like to create a cheap and easy-to-use backend for your clients, Sergio will show you how to do it in WordPress and consume it easily with Groovy on Android.
