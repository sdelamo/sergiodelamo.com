I want to thank [Graeme Rocher](https://x.com/graemerocher) and [Julia Kindelsberger](https://x.com/j_kindelsberger) for the opportunity to join the Oracle Labs GDK/Micronaut Team. This role will allow me to continue contributing to Micronaut. A passion, I have been dedicating myself to in the pasts years. 

The new job is quite a change for me. I had a small business, worked as a contractor - later as CTO - in a Spanish startup, and [worked as a contractor for a medium-sized US company](https://sergiodelamo.com/blog/2024-07-31-my-last-day-at-oci.html). All, with a common denominator, I have been self-employed since 2008. 

People start in big companies, then move on to create their own thing. I am doing my career in reverse order. :-]
