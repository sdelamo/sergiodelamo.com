# [%title]

I moved the old home page contents to a [projects page](https://sergiodelamo.com/projects.html).

Now, my home page contains the latest 20 posts. Most of my entries are links to other places where I publish content ([Micronaut Guides](https://guides.micronaut.io), [Micronaut Podcast](https://micronautpodcast.com), [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9UkPxJVi4FT3gitylnECKe27Aar1c_Er), and interesting links. Now the linked title of these posts sends you directly to the external URL. 

The &#9875; is a link to the permalink URL in my website for the post. The RSS Feed item's title links to my website, but the RSS Item adds a paragraph at the end of the post with the copy _Go to the linked site_ pointing to the external URL.
