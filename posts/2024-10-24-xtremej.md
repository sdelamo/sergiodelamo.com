## Getting Started with the Micronaut Framework

[%summary]

> This session introduces the Micronaut framework and demonstrates how the Frameworkâ€™s unique compile-time approach enables the development of ultra-lightweight Java applications. Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework include: + Develop applications with Java, Kotlin, or Apache Groovy + Sub-second startup time + Small processes that can run in as little as 10 MB of JVM heap + No runtime reflection + Dependency injection and AOP + Reflection-free serialization + A database access toolkit that uses ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces. + Cloud-native features. Sergio will also demonstrate how you can generate GraalVM native images of your Micronaut applications to achieve instant startup and ultra-low memory footprint.
