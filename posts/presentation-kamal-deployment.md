Kamal offers zero-downtime deploys, rolling restarts, asset bridging, remote builds, accessory service management, and everything you need to deploy and manage your web application in production with Docker.

During this talk, I will show you how to deploy a Micronaut application programmed with Java and compiled into a GraalVM native image with Docker and Kamal. Kamal works with any type of web app that can be containerized. Attend the talk, even if your programming language or framework does not match mine, as you will discover Kamal and how to use it with your toolset.

If you attend this talk, you will discover what Kamal is, what it offers, and how to deploy fast into production with Docker.

## Elevator Pitch

Docker deployments sound good, but for most companies, deploying with Kubernetes is too complex. Kamal offers a seamless deployment experience for any kind of application that can be containerized.

This presentation will show developers another way to deploy.
