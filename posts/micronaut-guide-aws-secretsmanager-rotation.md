# [%title]

I wrote a [Micronaut Guide](https://guides.micronaut.io) which shows how to develop a [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function with Micronaut framework to rotate a JWK (JSON Web Key) saved into [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/). 

To get the most of this guide, read these guides as well: 

- [JW Generation with a Micronaut Command Line Application](https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-cli-jwkgen.html)
- [JWK Keys endpoint](https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-security-keys-jwks.html)
- [Distributed Configuration with AWS Secrets Manager and the Micronaut framework](https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-aws-secretsmanager.html)
