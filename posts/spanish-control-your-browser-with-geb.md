[Northem Quality Community](https://northemquality.github.io/eventos_pasados.html), an online testing community, invited me to talk about Geb on June 20th.  This is a video of the talk.

I have a [code repository](https://github.com/sdelamo/geb-northemquality) with the sample covered during the talk and a little bit more.
