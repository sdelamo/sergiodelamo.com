In the 8th session of [Micronaut Live](https://sergiodelamo.com/blog/micronaut-live-introduction.html):

- We used [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) to send transactional emails. 
- We created an endpoint to send an email to every subscriber. 
- We added a feature to add unsubscribe links to emails.

Code: https://github.com/micronaut-advocacy/micronaut-live-newsletter

And, much more!.
