# [%title]

In this talk, Sergio del Amo discusses a serverless monolith architecture. An architecture composed of a big serverless function and some small functions for tasks such as schedule jobs, async notifications, and WebSockets. 



Sergio explains the different components of the architecture with a Micronaut application deployed to AWS. 



The talk covers authentication servers, static websites, serverless functions, and API Gateways.



Attendees will discover that they can have an architecture that scales on demand, is easy to reason about, and boosts developer productivity.
