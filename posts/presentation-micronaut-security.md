Similar presentation at [GRConf 2019](https://sergiodelamo.com/sergiodelamo.com/blog/gr8eu-2019-micronaut-security.html). 

Almost every application needs security. In this session, [Sergio del Amo](https://sergiodelamo.com) introduces [Micronaut Security](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/). 

You will learn about Micronaut security options: 

- Authentication (Basic Auth, Cookie-based, Session-based, Bearer, LDAP, X.509)
- Access authenticated user
- Security Configuration (@Secured, Intercept URL map...)
- OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code, Client Credentials, Password Credentials grants)
- OpenID Connect (Integration with third-party OAuth 2.0 server providers: Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, Amazon Cognito).
- JWT (Signing, Validation, Generation, JWKS)
- Token Propagation
- Security Events

During this talk, you will learn that working with Micronaut Security is easy and how to tailor it to your needs. 

Sergio del Amo is a Micronaut core committer, developer advocate, and host of the [Micronaut podcast](https://micronautpodcast.com).
