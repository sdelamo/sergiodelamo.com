I was looking to an equivalent to [Spock `@Issue` annotation](https://spockframework.org/spock/docs/2.3/extensions.html#_issue) for JUnit 5, and I found [JUnit Pioneer](https://junit-pioneer.org/docs/issue/).

> JUnit Pioneer provides extensions for JUnit 5 and its Jupiter API. It does not limit itself to proven ideas with wide application but is purposely open to experiments.
