I listened to Panic's Podcast latest episode - [The Story of Playdate](https://podcast.panic.com/#episode006). I gave up and I purchased a [Playdate](https://play.date).

When I was a child I had consoles (Atari, MasterSystem, Gameboy) and I played a lof of PC games but I don't play anymore. I have no console. I do not play games in my phone either. However, I love [Panic](https://panic.com)'s software. I am writing this post with [Nova](https://nova.app). I use [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) daily. I use [Prompt](https://panic.com/prompt/) in my iOS devices and I had use other Panic's products such as [Coda](https://panic.com/coda/) and [Status Board](https://panic.com/blog/the-panic-status-board/).

I purchased Playdate because I am intrigued with the device, the whole development experience SDK, to support Panic and to bring me back to my Gameboy days. Moreover, I have two small kids. It will be a nice suprise for them as well.
