I will be talking with [Tobias SchÃ¤fer](https://twitter.com/toschaef) and [Bernd RÃ¼cker](https://twitter.com/berndruecker) about integrating [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) and [Camunda](https://camunda.com).

> Workflow engines can complement modern microservice architectures to address common challenges. 

> In this complimentary webinar, we discuss these challenges and demonstrate how easy it is to add a workflow engine to your Micronaut environment. For this purpose, we provide an open source integration project to embed the Camunda workflow engine into Micronaut projects. The integration sets sensible defaults, so you can get started with minimum configuration: simply add a dependency in your Micronaut project.
