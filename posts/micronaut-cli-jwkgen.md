I wrote a tutorial which shows how to write a command line application with [Picocli](https://picocli.info/) and [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) to generate a [JWK (Json Web Key)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517). It delegates to [Nimbus Jose + JWT](https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt). I like JWKs and it is nice to have a command line util to generate them.
