summary: I found a way to enable this thanks to a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticalCalendar/comments/17ar6b4/support_unable_to_access_local_calendars/).

> Fantastical for Mac needs and extra step to enable the local calendar. I’ll copy and paste what they told (it’s working for me).

> - Copy the following line: [x-fantastical3://defaults?key=EventKitSyncAll&value=1&type=bool&group=1](x-fantastical3://defaults?key=EventKitSyncAll&value=1&type=bool&group=1)
> - Open your web browser
> - Paste the text into the URL field and press enter
> - Allow Fantastical to open
> - Confirm the alert that appears
> - Quit Fantastical completely (Click Fantastical in the menu bar and choose "Quit Fantastical Completely") then open the app again.
