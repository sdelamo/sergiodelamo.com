title: Add junit-platform-launcher to your Gradle JUnit 5 builds
summary: While updating [Micronaut repositories](https://github.com/micronaut-projects) to [Gradle 8.14](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#manually_declaring_dependencies), I had to add the `org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher` dependency as a `testRuntime` Gradle Configuration.
