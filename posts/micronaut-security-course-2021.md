# [%title]

I will be teaching a [Micronaut Security](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/index.html) 12 hour course next week. I am confident that after the course you will understand how to build secured Micronaut applications and how to test them. You don't need to be a Micronaut security expert. We will start from zero but we will go to more complex topics; JWT, JWKS or integration with OAuth 2.0 servers. 

📅 Dates: March 16, 17, 18, and 19, 2021.  
⏳ Time: 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. CDT.  
📍 Location: Online.  
👨🏻‍🏫 Instructor: Yours Truly.  
💵 Registration Fee: $199.00 USD.
