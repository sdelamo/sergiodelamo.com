I first heard about Infinity Pools in the [Focused Podcast](https://www.relay.fm/focused). I think that it comes from the book [Make Time: A Friendly Approach to Focus and Energy](https://maketime.blog)

> Infinity Pools are always-on, effectively infinite sources of information and entertainment.

For me, [as.com](https://as.com) and [marca.com](https://marca.com), two sport websites, were huge infinity pools on my phone. I deleted the native apps but I often found myself checking those websites on Safari for no other reason than habit. I want to focus my attention to other apps (e.g. [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com)) or better not use the phone and be more present. 

iOS has a setting `Screen Time -> Tap Content & Privacy Restrictions -> Content Restrictions -> Web Content` whose primary use is to limit adult content but you can block individual websites as well:
