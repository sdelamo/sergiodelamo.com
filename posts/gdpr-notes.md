I have watched [Andrew Norcross's GDPR for Developers]([%external_url]) talks.

I downloaded his slides and these are my notes:

**GDPR** stands for **G**eneral **D**ata **P**rotection **R**egulation

Keys:

- **Right to be informed.** 
- **Right to data access.**
- **Right to be forgotten.**
 
## Are users worried about Privacy?

- 92% worry about their privacy online
- 31% understand how companies collect and share their personal information.
- 74% have limited their online activity in the last year due to privacy concerns. 

## Data

This is all about data. In specific, personal user data.

In specific, data defined as *any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person*.

Data is worth Money.

### Data Ownership

 **The data does not belong to you anymore**.
 
> Because really, if you can't carry it on your back at a dead run, it never belong you anyway.

Patrick Graney.  
American Philosopher

We have never really considered the ownership of the data that came through the software we built. 

## Why does this matter?

James Liang. he’s the engineer for Volkswagen who was sentences to 40 months in prison for their emissions scandal.

An important note from the case: *While he was not the ‘mastermind’ he played a large role*.

## What should I do about it?

### What defines Personal Data?

*Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person*.  which is different than *personally identifiable information*.

- Racial or ethnic origin
- Political opinions
- Religious or philosophical beliefs
- Trade union membership
- Health data
- Sex life or sexual orientation
- Past or spent criminal convictions
- Genetic data
- Biometric data
- Location data
- Pseudonymized data
- Online identifiers

#### Online Identifiers

- IP addresses
- Mobile device ids
- RFID tags
- MAC Addresses
- Cookies / telemetry data
- User ids and emails

## Does it apply to me?

**GDPR applies to everyone** (who does business with the EU).
GDPR applies to all businesses, organizations, sectors, situations, and scenarios, regardless of size, employees, or revenues.

## How does it work?

Everything involving the entire data collection process basically falls under two baskets:

- **Data Controllers** - decides what data is collected, how it is used, and whom it is shared with.
- **Data Processor** - any entity other than the data controller who processes the data on their behalf.

# Privacy by design

Its a seven-point development methodology which requires optimal data protection to be provided as standard, by default, across all uses and applications. 

# Need to know everything

- What / how you’re collecting
- Where / how you’re storing it
- Who can access it

## Privacy impact assessment

This is a requirement for data-intensive projects and needs to be documented and made accessible for anyone involved with the project and can be requested by regulators in the event of a breach.

## FAQ

- Is this actually enforced? Yes. In January of 2019, France fines Google $57 million for GDPR violations.
- Will they really notice me? A German social media provider received an order to pay a €20,000 fine for a data breach that occurred in the summer of 2018. and they cooperated every step of the way.
- Ignorance is not an excuse.
- 
## Conclusion

- Privacy is paramount. User privacy (and security) is more important that anything marketing wants.
