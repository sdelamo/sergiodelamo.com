I discovered [Pushover](https://pushover.net) via Sixcolors's post - [Tools we used to make a call-in podcast](https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/09/tools-we-used-to-make-the-upgrade-call-in-podcast/).

> Pushover makes it easy to get real-time notifications on your Android, iPhone, iPad, and Desktop (Android Wear and Apple Watch, too!)

It is simple to integrate:

> For developers, system administrators, and everyone with just some technical savvy, our API makes it easy to integrate Pushover into your web app, network monitor, shell script, and anything else you can think of to send notifications to yourself or thousands of users.

It is such a useful idea. I tried it and it works like a charm.

 Moreover, I have started an Open Source [Micronaut Java library for Pushover](https://github.com/sdelamo/pushover). I hope to release a version of it soon.
