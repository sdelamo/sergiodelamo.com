I have used [Curated](https://curated.co) to publish my newsletter [Groovy Calamari](http://groovycalamari.com) since I started it. 

[%summary]

This Java library is built with [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) and it will allow you to consume the [Curated API](http://support.curated.co/integrations/getting-started-with-the-curated-api/).

I think it is a good example of [Micronaut's HTTP Client](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#httpClient) capabilities and how easy is to test with Micronaut.

I build with [Kordamp Gradle Plugins](https://kordamp.org/kordamp-gradle-plugins/). I publish it to [Bintray](https://bintray.com/beta/#/groovycalamari/maven/curatedapi). I use [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as a CI server. I publish the documentation written with [Asciidoc](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/) to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Check the Curated API library [documentation](https://github.com/sdelamo/curatedapi) and the [Github Repository](https://github.com/sdelamo/curatedapi).
