I will be talking at the [Groovy Track](https://www.apachecon.com/acah2020/tracks/groovy.html) in the online conference [ApacheCon](https://www.apachecon.com/acah2020/). 

I have two talks scheduled: 

## Micronaut + Groovy 

ðŸ“…Wednesday, 30 September 2020, 19:35 CEST

> In this talk, Micronaut committer, Sergio del Amo introduces the framework and demonstrates how you can take your web application development to the next level with Micronaut features and Groovy succinctness to create powerful applications in the most productive way. It showcases how to use Micronaut with Groovy related technologies such as GORM, Spock, Geb. After this talk you should have an understanding of what Micronaut development with Groovy looks like. No initial knowledge of Micronaut is required.

## Taming your browser with Geb 

ðŸ“…Wednesday, 30 September 2020, 20:55 CEST

> Geb is a Groovy layer on top of Selenium Webdriver. Geb integrates the Page Object patter, with CSS selectors and several DSLs to empower you to write browser test in an elegant and succinct way. In this beginner talk, Sergio de Amo, will introduce you to Geb and show you how to test a real Web. If you ever used Selenium, Geb opens a world of possibilities.
