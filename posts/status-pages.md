I do a lot of open source releases in my work. 

I have a checklist to verify the necessary services are available by visiting the following status pages: 

- [Gradle Status](https://status.gradle.com)
- [Sonatype](https://status.maven.org)
- [GitHub](https://www.githubstatus.com)

At [UnityFoundation](https://unityfoundation.io) we use [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com). Yesterday, Basecamp was suffering a DDOS attack and I visited their [status page](https://www.37status.com). It uses [Atlassian Statuspage](https://www.atlassian.com/software/statuspage). Atlassian statuspage has a free plan. 

> Our free plan gives you access to 100 subscribers, 25 components, two team members, two metrics, email notifications, Slack notifications, and access to REST APIs.
