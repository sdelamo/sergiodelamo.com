# [%title]

In the 9th session of [Micronaut Live](https://sergiodelamo.com/blog/micronaut-live-introduction.html):

- We integrated [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.com/), a Schema Migration Tool.
- We changed from H2 to PostgreSQL and used [TestContainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) to use the same DB for the tests.
- We used Swagger annotations to improve the generated OpenAPI documentation. 

Checkout the [Github repository](https://github.com/micronaut-advocacy/micronaut-live-newsletter/) which contains the application's code.

For another Micronaut Live session, [tune in to twitch](https://twitch.tv/micronautfw) Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10:30 a.m. CST / 17:30 CET to continue building a Micronaut Application.
