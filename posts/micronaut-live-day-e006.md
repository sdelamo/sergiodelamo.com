# [%title]

In the 6th session of [Micronaut Live](https://sergiodelamo.com/blog/micronaut-live-introduction.html):

- We integrate [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) into the application. 
- We create a [Thymleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org) template to render alerts. - We do redirections between controllers. 
- We learn how to instruct the HTTP Client to avoid following redirections.  
- We learn how to handle form submissions. 
- We set `dev` as the Micronaut default environment.

And, much more!.

Checkout the [Github repository](https://github.com/sdelamo/micronaut-live-newsletter/) which contains the application's code.
