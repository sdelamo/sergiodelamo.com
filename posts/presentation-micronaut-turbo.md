# [%title]

In this session, [Sergio del Amo](https://sergiodelamo.com) introduces [Turbo integration](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/#turbo) with the Micronaut® Framework.

[Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev) allows you to get the speed of a single-page web application without writing any JavaScript.

> Turbo bundles several techniques for creating fast, modern, progressively enhanced web applications without using much JavaScript. It offers a simpler alternative to the prevailing client-side frameworks, which put all the logic in the front-end and confine the server-side of your app to being little more than a JSON API.

Topics include:

- Integrating Turbo in a Micronaut Application.
- Use Micronaut Views Templates with Turbo Frames and Turbo Streams. 
- Respond Turbo Frames with the `@TurboFrameView` annotation.
- Respond to form submissions using just HTML and a set of CRUD-like actions with Turbo Streams.
- Deliver page changes with Turbo Streams over WebSockets.
- Respond Turbo Streams with the `@TurboView` annotation.

Micronaut Turbo brings back the joy of building web applications with JVM languages.

## Target Attendees

Everyone is welcome. However, we recommend attendees have at least a working familiarity with web development, HTTP, Java, and JVM development frameworks. Experience with Micronaut is a plus, but not required.

## Technical Requirements

For the lab exercises, you will need JDK 11 and IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition or Ultimate.
