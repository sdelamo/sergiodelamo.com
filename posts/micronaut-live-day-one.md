The first day of [Micronaut Live](https://sergiodelamo.com/blog/micronaut-live-introduction.html) was fun. We covered:

- Micronaut application generation with [launch.micronaut.io](https://launch.micronaut.io)
- Github Repository creation
- Continuous integration with Github Actions
- DTOs Validation Testing
- Health Check endpoint
- Problem+JSON for Error Processing
- Open API documentation generation.
- Route HTTP Body payload validation. 

Checkout the [Github repository](https://github.com/micronaut-advocacy/micronaut-live-newsletter/) which contains the application's code.

For another Micronaut Live session, [tune in to twitch](https://twitch.tv/micronautfw) today at 10:30 a.m. CDT / 17:30 CET to continue building a Micronaut Application.
