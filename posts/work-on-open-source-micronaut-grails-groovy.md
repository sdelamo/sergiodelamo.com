# [%title]

We have an [opening in our open-source (OSS) team](https://jobs.lever.co/oci/ead05337-ea10-46c7-88bc-fff2f4f0e407) at [Object Computing](https://objectcomputing.com). You could be contributing daily to [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) and help us reshape the JVM frameworks' space. Working in Open Source is challenging, but it is fulfilling. 

It is remote-friendly. Indeed, all of us in the 2GM (Grails, Groovy Micronaut) team are working remotely. 

If you have any doubt, you can [reach out to me](https://sergiodelamo.com/contact.html).
