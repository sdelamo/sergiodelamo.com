In the 3rd session of [Micronaut Live](https://sergiodelamo.com/blog/micronaut-live-introduction.html), I integrate [Micronaut Security JWT](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#jwt) to the application. To confirm the newsletter subscription, the application will send a signed JWT with the user's email in the token claims.

Checkout the [Github repository](https://github.com/sdelamo/micronaut-live-newsletter/) which contains the application's code.

For another Micronaut Live session, [tune in to twitch](https://twitch.tv/micronautfw) tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. CDT / 17:30 CET to continue building a Micronaut Application.
